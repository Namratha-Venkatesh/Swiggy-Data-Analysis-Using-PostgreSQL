This README provides an overview of the Swiggy Data Analysis project, which is a completed project for analyzing Swiggy's data using PostgreSQL.

## Introduction

The Swiggy Data Analysis project is aimed at extracting valuable insights from Swiggy's data using PostgreSQL. The analysis encompasses various aspects of the business, including customer behavior, restaurant performance, delivery operations, and more.

## Database Setup

The database setup phase involves:

- Creating a PostgreSQL database.
- Importing Swiggy data into the database.
- Defining the database schema and relationships between tables.
- Data cleaning and transformation, if necessary.

## Queries

The queries used in this project include:

- Basic analytics to calculate statistics like average order value, order frequency, and customer retention.
- Customer segmentation based on ordering behavior, location, or other criteria.
- Restaurant performance evaluation, including order volume, customer ratings, and delivery times.
- Delivery data analysis to optimize routes, reduce delivery times, and improve efficiency.
- Marketing insights to identify trends and patterns, such as popular cuisines, peak order times, and customer preferences.

## Conclusion

The Swiggy Data Analysis project demonstrates the use of PostgreSQL for analyzing Swiggy's data and extracting valuable insights. It serves as a reference for future data analysis projects and showcases the potential of using SQL for deriving meaningful business insights.
